# Motivations

With the rise of music streaming services on the internet in the 2010’s, many have moved away from radio stations to streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. This shift offers more specificity and personalization to users’ listening experiences, especially with the ability to create playlists of whatever songs that they wish. Oftentimes user playlists have a similar genre or theme between each song, and some streaming services like Spotify offer recommendations to expand a user’s existing playlist based on the songs in it. Using Node2vec and GraphSAGE graph neural network methods, we set out to create a recommender system for songs to add to an existing playlist by drawing information from a vast graph of songs we built from playlist co-occurrences (edges between two songs that exist in the same playlist). The result is a personalized song recommender based not only on Spotify’s community of playlist creators, but also the specific features within a song.

# Data

Our song song recommendation system will work with any music dataset that contains a community of users with playlists that they have created. The most popular of these would likely come from Apple Music, Spotify, Youtube, or Amazon as they are by far the most used music streaming services in America (that support playlist creation) as of January 2021 [1]. In all the markets Spotify and Youtube contend for the most used, but Youtube is not solely a music streaming service, and they do not release data for public use as readily as Spotify does, so we chose to go with Spotify as our dataset.

In January 2018, Spotify released a vast dataset containing 1 million playlists created by users between January 2010, and October 2017 for the purpose of an online data competition to try to predict subsequent tracks within a playlist [2]. Though the competition is over, we used this dataset of user’s playlists to try to create personalized recommendations for a user’s playlist. Currently we have taken the first ten thousand playlists from this dataset to train our model on, though scaling up to include more playlists (and subsequently songs) is possible, but currently not necessary for us to demonstrate the efficacy of this recommender. 

Additionally we used Spotify's API to obtain various musical features of songs in order to enrich the recommender to learn from not only the graph structure we created for songs, but also learn from unique aspects of the songs themselves. Some of these features include acousticness, instrumentalness, and danceability as described by Spotify and their algorithmic scoring of such categories.
